	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ruːl ˈtɒlkiːn/;[a] 3 January 
1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer, poet, philologist, and 
academic, who authored the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit, The 
Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. He served as the Rawlinson and 
Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and Fellow of Pembroke College, 
Oxford, from 1925 to 1945 and Merton Professor of English Language and 
Literature and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, from 1945 to 1959.[3] 
He was at one time a close friend of C. S. Lewis—they were both members 
of the informal literary discussion group known as the Inklings. Tolkien
 was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen 
Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. </p>

	<h3>Biography</h3>
	<p>Tolkien's immediate paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen 
who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. 
The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town Kreuzburg near 
Königsberg, which was founded during medieval German eastward expansion,
 where his earliest-known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born 
around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663–1746) was a wealthy 
miller in Kreuzburg. His son Christian Tolkien (1706–1791) moved from 
Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien 
(1747–1813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien 
(1752–1819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of
 the English family; the younger brother was J. R. R. Tolkien's second 
great-grandfather. In 1792 John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell 
took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on 
sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell &amp; Tolkien. Daniel 
Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin 
apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also 
joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname 
Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as 
J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern Germany, but most of them are 
descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in 1945, at the end of 
World War II.[11][12][13][14] According to Ryszard Derdziński the 
Tolkien name is of Low Prussian origin and probably means 
"son/descendant of Tolk."[11][12] Tolkien mistakenly believed his 
surname derived from the German word tollkühn, meaning "foolhardy",[15] 
and jokingly inserted himself as a "cameo" into The Notion Club Papers 
under the literally translated name Rashbold.[16] However, Derdziński 
has demonstrated this to be a false etymology.[11][12] While J. R. R. 
Tolkien was aware of the Tolkien family's German origin, his knowledge 
of the family's history was limited because he was "early isolated from 
the family of his prematurely deceased father".[11][12] </p>

	<h2>Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics</h2>
	<img class="cover" src="History%20of%20Tolkein%20Books_files/24-4.jpg" alt="cover for the monsters and the">
	<p> As well as his fiction, Tolkien was also a leading author of 
academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published 
as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic 
Beowulf by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the
 study of Old English literature to this day. Beowulf is one of the most
 significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details
 of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the 
poem. The piece reveals many of the aspects of Beowulf which Tolkien 
found most inspiring, most prominently the role of monsters in 
literature, particularly that of the dragon which appears in the final 
third of the poem: As for the poem, one dragon, however hot, does not 
make a summer, or a host; and a man might well exchange for one good 
dragon what he would not sell for a wilderness. And dragons, real 
dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or 
tale, are actually rare.[160] </p>
	<h2>On Fairy-Stories</h2>
	<img class="cover" src="History%20of%20Tolkein%20Books_files/a_002.jpg" alt="cover of on fairy stories">
	<p>This essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. It was 
initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of 
St Andrews, Scotland. Tolkien focuses on Andrew Lang's work as a 
folklorist and collector of fairy tales. He disagreed with Lang's broad 
inclusion, in his Fairy Book collections, of traveller's tales, beast 
fables, and other types of stories. Tolkien held a narrower perspective,
 viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie, an enchanted 
realm, with or without fairies as characters. He viewed them as the 
natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human 
language. </p>
	<h2>The Hobbit</h2>
	<img class="cover" src="History%20of%20Tolkein%20Books_files/a.jpg" alt="art for The Hobbit">
	<p>Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer 
accident a book called The Hobbit, which he had written some years 
before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan 
Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen &amp; 
Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.[101] When it 
was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as 
children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien
 to produce a sequel. </p>
	<h2>The Lord of the Rings</h2>
	<img class="cover" src="History%20of%20Tolkein%20Books_files/507311-_amazon91jbdarvqml.jpg" alt="cover for the Lord of the Rings">
	<p>The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what would become
 his most famous work: the epic novel The Lord of the Rings (originally 
published in three volumes 1954–1955). Tolkien spent more than ten years
 writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings,
 during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in 
particular his closest friend C. S. Lewis, the author of The Chronicles 
of Narnia. Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the
 background of The Silmarillion, but in a time long after it. </p>
